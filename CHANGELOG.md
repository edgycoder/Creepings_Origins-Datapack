# Changelog

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/edgycoder/Creepings_Origins-Datapack/releases/tag/2.0.0)

### Additions
- Creepings now uses [Identify mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/identity) as dependency to morph the player into a real creeper.
- Friendly Creepers is now included with Identify (unless you have choses different settings)\*.
- Pressing `R` gives the player the ability to explode without griefing (thanks to Identify).

\* The settings that I use can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/edgycoder/3b12b0c5b649273dcde2e6a65b8c12f7)
### Deletions
- Color change has been removed since the player becomes a real creeper now.

### Extra notes
Although I created a `G` ability to explode using a more powerful creeper spawn.  
I won't be sure if I keep this one in or change it to another ability.  
For now I keep both explosions in the Origin so **more explosion powerrr**
